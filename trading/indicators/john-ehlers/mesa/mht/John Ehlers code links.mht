							<p>JOHN EHLERS INDICATORS: I have compiled most of the indicators on=
 this page from Ehlers books. Some adjustments have been made for clarity o=
r to get them to work properly. They have all verified in TradeStation but =
no guarantees of perfection or proper functionality are implied. The MESA f=
ormula (Maximum Entropy Spectral Analysis) which is used in many of these i=
ndicators, was originally developed to interpret seismographic information =
for oil exploration. They have been adapted here for measuring market cycle=
s - they produce high resolution outputs with exceptionally short amounts o=
f information, an ideal combination for market evaluation.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/MAMA_FAMA_Ind.html">MAMA FAM=
A Indicator</a>: - MAMA stands for MESA Adaptive Moving Average (It has als=
o been dubbed Mother of All Moving Averages). This is a MA that adjusts its=
elf to up/down cycles and is very robust - I&#x27;m planning to incorporate=
 it into some strategies soon.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Fisher_Transform_Ind.html">F=
isher Transform Indicator</a>: This is a very fast crossover trade trigger =
indicator and if used in conjunction with a good trend-following tool it is=
 predictive and can be applied in strategies (coming soon). When compared t=
o MACD or other crossover indicators the Fisher Transform is clearly superi=
or and timely.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/iTrend_Ind.html">Instantaneo=
us Trend Indicator</a> (iTrend): Trend indicator with nearly zero lag and a=
bout the same smoothing as EMA. Trade signals are generated by crossing of =
the trigger line and iTrend line.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/CenterOfGravity_indicator.ht=
ml">Center of Gravity Indicator</a>: Another Ehlers oscillator - I have not=
 experimented much with this one - may require an additional trend indicato=
r to help function best - do your own testing.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Cyber_Cycle.html">Cyber Cycl=
e Indicator</a>: An early Ehlers indicator that attempts to measure market =
cycles.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Cycle_Measure.html">Cycle Me=
asure indicator</a>: Same as Cycle Period indicator. Another Cycle Measurin=
g indicator, more robust than the one above, but with only one line - no cr=
ossovers.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Fisher_CyberCycle_Ind.html">=
Fisher Cyber Cycle Indicator</a>: A cycle measuring indicator with a Fisher=
 Transform modification.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Relative_Vigor_Index.html">R=
elative Vigor Index</a>: The concept of RVI is that prices close higher tha=
n they open in up mkts and v.v. in down mkts. RVI is an oscillator where mo=
vement is normalized to the trading range of each bar. It uses four-bar sym=
etrical FIR lag-cancelling filters to produce a readable indicator.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Stochastic_CG_Osc.html">Stoc=
hastic CG Oscillator</a>: Rev.10/01/08 Several indicators have been modifie=
d with a stochastic algorithm. In some cases this improves performance but =
not significantly.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Stochastic_Cyber_Cycle.html"=
>Stochastic Cyber Cycle indicator</a>: Rev. 10/01/08 -Same comment as above=
.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Fisher_Stochastic_CG_Osc.htm=
l">Fisher Stochastic CG Oscillator</a>: The Fisher Stochastic CG indicator/=
oscillator is similar to the Stochastic CG Oscillator but with sharper reve=
rsals and occasionally earlier signals.</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Stochastic_RSI_Ind.html">Sto=
chastic RSI indicator</a>:</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/Stochastic_RVI.html">Stochas=
tic RVI index</a>: Rev.10/01/08 -The concept of RVI is that prices close hi=
gher than they open in up mkts and v.v. in down mkts. RVI is an oscillator =
where movement is<br />
								normalized to the trading range of each bar. It uses four-bar symet=
rical FIR lag-cancelling filters to produce a readable indicator.</p>

">Cycle Period Calculator</a>: posted 8/26/08</p>
							<p>These adaptive indicators are more responsive than their static (=
non-adaptive) counterparts. They are meant to eliminate lag. The sine wave =
(coming soon) is supposed to be predictive.</p>

aptive Cyber Cycle</a>: posted 8/26/08</p>

RVI</a>: posted 8/26/08</p>
							<p><a href=3D"TS_Code/Ehlers_Indicators/SineWave_Ind.html">Sine Wave=
 Indicator</a>: posted 8/27/08 - This indicator tries to determine the curr=
ent phase of the cycle you are in, has an advantage over other oscillators =
such as RSI and Stochastic because it predicts rather than waits for confir=
mation. SW gives entry and exit signals 1/16th of a cycle period in advance=
 of the cycle turning point and seldom gives false whipsaw signals when the=
 market is in a trend mode.</p>
