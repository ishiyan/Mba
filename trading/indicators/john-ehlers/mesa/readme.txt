ANTAEAN OSCILLATORS
This collection of oscillators are those that either mark the market turning points with surgical precision or have exceptionally low lag.
With these oscillators there is no longer a need to wait for confirming signals.
The oscillators come as ELS code for plug-in to your TradeStation.
Each oscillator is described in an accompanying information file.
The EasyLanguage code is open and not protected.
The oscillators in this collection are:

Sinewave
Cyber Cycle
Stochastic RSI
Fisher Transform
Inverse Fisher Transform
CG Oscillator

HERCULEAN SMOOTHERS
The indicators in this collection are adaptive to market volatility or are nonlinear filters used to smooth the data.
If your trading encounters whipsaw trades, these nonlinear filters may be your answer.
These filters move rapidly when the market moves rapidly, but remain steady and smooth in sideways markets.
The filters come as ELS code for plug-in to your TradeStation.
Each filter is described in an accompanying information file.
The EasyLanguage code is open and not protected.
The smoothers in this collection are:

KAMA (Kaufman Adaptive Moving Average)
VIDYA (Variable Index Dynamic Average)
MAMA (MESA Adaptive Moving Average)
EHLERS Filter
Median Filter
MA-Median Difference Tuned Moving Average
Nonlinear Laguerre
